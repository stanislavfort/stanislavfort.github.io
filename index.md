I am currently a PhD student at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> with <a href="https://ganguli-gang.stanford.edu/surya.html">Prof Surya Ganguli</a> at the <a href = "https://ganguli-gang.stanford.edu/">Neural Dynamics and Computation Lab</a> and an <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/open-phil-ai-fellowship-2020-class">OpenPhil AI Fellow</a>. Before that, I was a <a href="https://ai.google/research/join-us/ai-residency/">Google AI Resident</a> working on understanding deep learning, and a Research Scientist Intern at <a href="https://deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a> working on scaling theoretical insights up.

During my year at Google Research, I started and led 5 research projects collaborating with scientists from <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/brain/">Google Brain</a> and <a href="https://deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a>.

My research spans machine learning, AI, and physics. I focus on 1) developing the <b>Science of Deep Learning</b> (a principled, scientific understanding of deep learning), and 2) <b>applying ML to quantum and astrophysics</b> problems. I am excited about applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in physics, emergent phenomena, and the role of complexity and openendedness.


I completed my Bachelors and Masters (Part III of the Tripos) at <a href="http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/">Trinity College</a>, <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>, and another Masters at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>.

In the past I worked at <a href = "http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/">Institute of Astronomy</a> on galaxy clusters in X-ray, <a href = "http://www.aei.mpg.de/">Albert Einstein Institute</a> on large scale data mining for pulsar discovery, <a href = "http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/">Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics</a> on perturbative approaches to black hole formation in <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence">AdS</a>-like geometries, and <a href = "http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/">DAMTP</a> on cross-correlations of gamma-rays and the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background">CMB</a> in the sky.


I actively co-organize and coach at the <a href="http://olympiada.astro.cz/">Czech Astronomy Olympiad</a>, setting problems and preparing students for the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_on_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics">IOAA</a> (where I ranked #1 worldwide in 2011). I sometimes lecture at the <a href = "http://fyzikalniolympiada.cz">Czech Physics Olympiad</a> and prepare students for <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Physics_Olympiad">IPhO</a>. I co-organized the 1st and 2nd  <a href = "https://www.to.ee/download/m57c83230832fc/full" >International Workshop on Astronomy and Astrophysics</a> in Estonia and the Czech Republic. I am also an amateur astrophotographer.

I am reviewing for ML/AI conference, including NeurIPS (top 10% of high-scoring reviewers in 2020), ICML, ICLR, AAAI, and many workshops.

On top of my research, I work on a number of side projects in mathematics, physics, and CS.
