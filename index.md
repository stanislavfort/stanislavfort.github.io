I am currently a PhD student at Stanford University with [Prof Surya Ganguli](https://ganguli-gang.stanford.edu/index.html) at the *Neural Dynamics and Computation Lab*, an [OpenPhil AI Fellow](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/open-phil-ai-fellowship-2020-class), and Research Scientist Intern at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/).

 Before that, I was a Google AI Resident working on understanding deep learning, collaborating with researchers from [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/) and [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/). I completed my Bachelors and Masters (Part III of the Tripos) at [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and another Masters at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/).

I am interested in **understanding deep learning**, with the goal of contributing to the *Science of Deep Learning* and AI safety, and **applying machine learning and differentiable programming to physics**, with a particular focus on quantum.

My [personal website](http://stanford.edu/~sfort1/) contains more details about my research and background.
