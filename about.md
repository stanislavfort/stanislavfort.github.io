# About 

I am currently a PhD student at Stanford University with [Prof Surya Ganguli](https://ganguli-gang.stanford.edu/index.html) at the *Neural Dynamics and Computation Lab*. Before that, I was a Google AI Resident working on understanding deep learning, collaborating with researchers from [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/) and [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/). I completed my Bachelors and Masters (Part III of the Tripos) at [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and another Masters at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). 

My research spans two directions:
1. **Understanding deep learning**, with the goal of contributing to the *Science of Deep Learning*
2. **Applying machine learning and differentiable programming to physics**, with a particular focus on astrophysics and quantum

My [personal website](http://stanford.edu/~sfort1/) contains more details about research and background.
